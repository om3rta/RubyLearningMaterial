#A note on .method!
#Adding ! at the end of a string manipulation method will
#update the variable without having to create a new one
#example after this comment:

#opperators
# == - equals, like 3 == 3
# != - does not equal, like 3 != 4
#<, >, <=, >= - Less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to
# && (and), like 77 < 78 && 77 < 77 would be true AND false, which would ultimately be false
#|| (or), like 3 != 4 || 3 == 4, this would resolve to true because one is actually true
#! (not), like !true is flase and !false is true

#arrays
my_array = [1,2,3,4,5] #<-- Pretty standard
